        <p>
          I'm currently a <i> Full Stack Software Development </i> student at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://lambtoncollege.ca/"
            >The Lambton College</a
          >
          in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. I have a strong passion for technology and
          love to explore new things in the tech world.
        </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Back in my Home country, <i>Nepal</i>, during my college, I had the
          opportunity to work as intern at
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lanceme-up/posts/?feedView=all"
            >lanceme Up</a
          >. Shortly, after that, I worked as a
          <i>Backend Associate developer</i> at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ramailo.tech/"
            >ramailotech (Idea2MVP)</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          After working at ramailotech for a year, I was promoted to
          <i>Backend Developer</i> role. During my time there, I worked on
          several big projects. Some of the notable projects I worked on include
          <i>College Management System</i>, <i>ChatBot AI System</i>,
          <i>E-Commerce Website</i>, and few others.
        </p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I've always been fascinated by technology and its inner workings. I've
          always wondered how things work behind the scenes, which led me to
          explore various tech projects. Over the years, I've worked on several
          web development projects, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than web development projects, I have also worked on projects
          like <i>compilers</i>, <i>interpreters</i>, <i>emulators</i>,
          <i>game development</i>, <i>text-editor</i> and more. There are still
          so many projects I have worked on but never finished. The most
          prominent reason being lack of time and the complexity of the project.
          However, I have promised myself to complete those
          <strong>unfinished</strong>
          projects in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are <strong>100s</strong> of repositories on my
          <a href="https://github.com/sjnprjl">GitHub</a> about my personal
          projects (publics and privates). Some are completed while others are
          half-way done
          <span style="font-style: italic"
            >(which I've made private because I'm too embarrassed to share
            it)</span
          >
          which I never went back to finish. Here are some of my
          <strong>**finished**</strong> projects which I am proud to share:
        </p>

        <h3>SLang</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first-ever programming language projects.
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sjnprjl/slang">SLang</a>
          is a very simple interpreted language built using <i>Typescript</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built this project, because it always fascinated me how the code,
          written in high-level human readable languages, are understood by the
          machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building this project taught me a lot about <i>parser</i>,
          <i>lexer</i>, <i>interpreter</i>, and many more. And finally, I was
          able to understand how it all <strong>**works**</strong>.

        <h3>Fractal Tree Generator</h3>
        <blockquote>
          In geometry, a fractal canopy, a type of fractal tree, is one of the
          easiest-to-create types of fractals. Each canopy is created by
          splitting a line segment into two smaller segments at the end
          (symmetric binary tree), and then splitting the two smaller segments
          as well, and so on, infinitely. Canopies are distinguished by the
          angle between concurrent adjacent segments and ratio between lengths
          of successive segments.
          <br />
          <br />

            >Wikiwand</a
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I built this project using <i>HTML5 Canvas</i> and <i>Javascript</i>.
          The project generates a fractal tree based on user inputs like angle,
          length ratio, and depth. The tree is drawn recursively using the
          canvas API.

        <h3 id="chip8">Chip 8 Emulator</h3>
        <blockquote>
          CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph
          Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and other
          computers of the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8
          virtual machine.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I built this project using <i>Typescript</i> and <i>HTML5 Canvas</i>.
          The project emulates the CHIP-8 virtual machine, allowing users to run
          CHIP-8 programs on their computers. The emulator includes features
          like graphics rendering, input handling, and sounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wanted to build this project to understand how emulators work.
          Whenever, someone search on the internet about the emulation building,
          they are recommended to build the Chip8 Emulator first to get their
          hands dirty.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, I tried building this project. It is not a complicated emulation
          project to begin with, but there are a lots of nuances to take care of
          when building the emulator. Whenever one is building the chip-8
          emulator, they need to make sure they test every instructions
          properly. Because if you don't, you will end up
          <strong>**staring**</strong> at your code for hours.

        <h3>Minesweeper Game</h3>
        <p>
          I built this game using <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and
          <i>Typescript</i>. The project is a simple implementation of the
          classic Minesweeper game. Users can select the difficulty level and
          play the game by clicking on the cells to reveal them. The game
          includes features like timer, flagging, and score tracking.

        </p>

        <h3>Raptor Interpreter</h3>
        <p>
          This project is also an emulator project and it is one of my favorite
          personal projects that I have worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little background on what this project is all about. So, the college I
          currently study at, <i>The Lambton College</i>, on my first semester,
          I needed to learn the basics of programming: loops, conditions,
          functions, etc. using a tool called
          <a href="https://raptor.martincarlisle.com/">Raptor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The raptor is a flowchart-based programming environment, which allows
          students to visualize their algorithms. It uses flowcharts to
          represent the control flow of a program and allows students to
          experiment with different algorithms. The raptor is a tool that allows
          students to experiment with different algorithms and programming
          languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whenever you save the flowchart in raptor, it saves the file with a
          <strong>.rap</strong> extension. So, I wanted to build a tool that can
          decode what the <strong>.rap</strong> files holds and interpret it
          using <i>Node.js</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          After weeks of hard work, and a lot of digging through the files, I
          was able to build the tool I was hoping to build.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Space Invaders Emulator</h3>
        <p>
          This is yet another emulator project that I built using
          <i>Javascript</i>, and <i>HTML Canvas API</i>. After I completed my
          <a href="#chip8">Chip8 Emulator</a>, and failing miserably to build a
          <i>Gameboy Emulator</i>, I decided to build a Space Invaders Emulator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, the game is run on
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Intel_8080"
          >
            intel 8080 microprocessor</a
          >. So, I had to first understand how the intel 8080 works, and then
          build the emulator around it.
        </p>
